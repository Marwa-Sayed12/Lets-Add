Hacktoberfest 2021 is a month long virtual festival event to celebrate open source contributions presented by Digital Ocean, Intel and DEV. It is the easiest way to get into open source!
https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/
During the entire month of October 2020, all you have to do is contribute to any open source projects and open at least 4 pull requests. Yes, any project and any kind of contributions. You don‚Äôt need to be an expert in programming or coding. It can be a be a bug fix, improvement, or even a documentation change! And win an awesome T-shirt and awesome stickers.

## üòï Why Should I Contribute?

The Hacktoberfest‚Äôs simple plain objective is:

    Support open source and earn a limited edition T-shirt!

But, it‚Äôs not just about the t-shirts or stickers. Its about supporting open source. Its about celebrating open source, and giving it back. If you‚Äôve never contributed to open source before, this is the perfect time to get started because Hacktoberfest provides a large list of available contribution opportunities (and yes, there are always plenty for beginners too).

## üëå What Can I Contribute?

Whether you‚Äôre a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community.

It doesn‚Äôt need to be code. It can be even documentation. Or spelling fix.
